# Performance-Analysis-of-Progressive-Web-Apps-vs-Native-Apps
This project focuses on the performance analysis of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and Native Mobile Apps. As mobile usage continues to grow, developers often face the challenge of choosing between building a PWA or a native app. Each approach offers distinct advantages and trade-offs in terms of performance, user experience, and development effort.

In this project, I developed both a PWA and a Native Mobile App with similar functionalities, designed to simulate resource-intensive tasks. The goal is to compare their performance across key metrics such as:

Load time

Responsiveness

Offline functionality

CPU and memory usage

Battery consumption

By conducting controlled tests and gathering real-world data, this project aims to provide insights into how PWAs and native apps behave under different conditions. The findings can help developers and businesses make informed decisions when selecting the best platform for their application needs.
